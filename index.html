    <p>Sheila Levrant de Bretteville: Community, Activism, and Design is the first monographic exhibition on this renowned graphic designer, public artist, <br>
      and educator, whose community-based and politically responsive work champions principles of advocacy and inclusion. De Bretteville (b. 1940, B.F.A. 1963, M.F.A. 1964) <br>
      is well known for her important and early contributions to the field of feminist design and education; in 1973, with the artist Judy Chicago and the art historian <br>
      and critic Arlene Raven, de Bretteville established the Woman’s Building and the Feminist Studio Workshop—the first independent art school for women and women’s <br>
      culture—in downtown Los Angeles. This exhibition presents a rich array of materials drawn from the artist’s extensive archive to highlight pivotal moments in her <br>
      multifaceted and trailblazing career. On view are dynamic and rarely seen promotional materials that de Bretteville made for Yale University Press and the Italian <br>
      manufacturer Olivetti shortly after she graduated from the Yale School of Art; posters and broadsheets produced while she was living in Los Angeles that blend word and <br>
      image to advance woman-focused initiatives, many of which have become icons of feminist design; and photographs and models of her public art installations, which <br>
      reflect her ongoing commitment to the feminist movement and issues such as immigration and racial equity. Representing a shift in scale and focus from the printed <br>
      page to the urban environment, these public projects, which have not been closely examined as a group until now, include “Biddy Mason: Time and Place” (Los Angeles, <br>
      1989–90), an expansive sculptural mural honoring a formerly enslaved midwife made in collaboration with the artist Betye Saar, and “Hillhouse” (New Haven, <br>
      Connecticut, 2003), the revitalization of the entrance to a local high school. De Bretteville’s accomplishments continue to have lasting effects: In 1990 she was <br>
      named director of graduate studies in graphic design at Yale and became the first woman at the Yale School of Art to be awarded tenure. Her vision has shaped a new <br>
      generation of graphic design.
